        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Aklesh, and I am an
        aspiring web developer and hobbyist game developer. I believe that
        technology has the power to connect people and transform lives, and I am
        passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences that make a
        difference in people's lives. My journey into the world of coding began
        as a hobby, but I quickly realized that this was my calling. With a
        background in CS, I have honed my skills in html, css, tailwind,
        javascript including react. I enjoy learning about new technologies and
        tools that can enhance my work and help me build better experiences for
        my users. I am committed to creating clean, user-friendly interfaces
        that make navigating complex systems a breeze. From responsive design to
        accessibility, I take ensure that every aspect of a website is carefully
        considered to deliver the best possible user experience. But beyond my
        technical skills, I am also a creative problem-solver with a passion for
        collaboration. I believe that the best solutions come from working
        together, and I always strive to bring a positive attitude and a
        willingness to learn to every project I'm a part of. When I'm not coding
        or designing, you can find me playing video games, reading and watching
        shows. I'm also an avid reader and enjoy learning about new subjects.
        Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. If you're
        interested in collaborating on a project or just want to say hello,
        don't hesitate to reach out!

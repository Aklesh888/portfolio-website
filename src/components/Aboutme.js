          Greetings! My name is Aklesh, and I am an aspiring web developer and
          hobbyist game developer. I believe that technology has the power to
          connect people and transform lives, and I am passionate about creating
          meaningful digital experiences that make a difference in people's lives.
          With a background in CS, I have honed my skills in html, css, tailwind,
          javascript including react. I am constantly learning and expanding my
          knowledge in the ever-evolving world of web development and game design,
          and I am always up for a new challenge. When it comes to web
          development, I believe that form should always follow function. I am
          committed to creating clean, user-friendly interfaces that make
          navigating complex systems a breeze. From responsive design to
          accessibility, I take pride in ensuring that every aspect of a website
          is carefully considered to deliver the best possible user experience. As
          a hobbyist game developer, I see games as a medium for storytelling and
          creativity. Whether it's designing levels, creating game mechanics, or
          crafting compelling narratives, I approach every aspect of game
          development with a focus on fun and engagement. But beyond my technical
          skills, I am also a creative problem-solver with a passion for
          collaboration. I believe that the best solutions come from working
          together, and I always strive to bring a positive attitude and a
          willingness to learn to every project I'm a part of. When I'm not coding
          or designing, you can find me playing video games and watching shows. I
          believe that a well-rounded life is essential for creativity and
          personal growth, and I am always seeking out new experiences and
          opportunities to learn. Thank you for taking the time to learn more
          about me. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just
          want to say hello, don't hesitate to reach out!
